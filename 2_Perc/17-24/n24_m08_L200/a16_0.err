 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      97.922   TIME= 21:33:51
 The eigenproblem is ill-conditioned (relative residual from test linear 
 solve: 1.031882E-03).  The accuracy of the solution may not be          
 satisfactory.  Modifying the initial value of the frequency shift       
 (FREQB in the MODOPT command) or changing the boundary conditions of    
 the model might solve the problem.                                      
                                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     108.875   TIME= 21:34:03
 Fewer modes than the requested number of modes ( 12 ) were computed.    
 There are only 1 modes beyond the begin frequency of FREQB= 0.
